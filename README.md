I use these technologies to made this project that I discuss below:-

**FRONT END**:- HTML , BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY

**DESIGNING** :- CSS


**1.Add Task**

In add task functionality I use a array and I made a object that both fields are stored in it and this object is stored in the 
array with the help of the index property I display all the fields in the  browser.


**2.Remove Task**

In remove functionality I use a anchor tag and when the user click that link the list will be removed and it will be removed with
the help of the index property.


**3.Modify Task**

In Modify functionality I use a anchor tag and when the user click that link the values of both the field shown in fields and the 
add button will be hide and done button will be displayed and user click that done button the list will be modified.


**4.Search Task**

In search functionality this serch field and button will be display only when the user add the item > 0 so the search field and button
will be displayed and when the user click the search button the values will be searched.


**5.Drag & Drop**

In drag and drop functionality I use a jQuery plugin that is sortable it provides the index automatically current and old index
with the help of the index property drag and drop operation will be performed.


**6.Change Status(Pending or Done)**

In change Status Functionality I get a current index of the list and adding a true or false property , by default it shows pending
but the user click the pending it convert into Done.
